This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for data on physical samples. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Excel workbook documents a content model for basic data characterizing a physical sample. The content model is based on consideration of content requested for SESAR, EarthTime, GeoSciML, Storet, ISO19115.  Focus is on terrestrial (land based) samples. Content model includes sufficient information for SESAR registration (see http://www.geosamples.org/), but is not complete with all possible content in the SESAR sample data model.
 
Current services are deployed in the tagged 0.8 version.
